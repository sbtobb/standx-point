- Kept existing glob re-exports in `src/lib.rs` to avoid expanding scope beyond requested changes.
- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` on `StandxClient` and its impl to keep diagnostics clean until HTTP methods are used by later tasks.
- Kept auth flow types (`SigninData`, `LoginResponse`) local to `auth::manager` per task instructions and left HTTP calls as `todo!()` placeholders.
- Used UUID v4 for request id generation in `RequestSigner` to match task requirements.
- 鉴于 `StandxClient` 基础 URL 尚不可注入，集成测试使用 wiremock + reqwest 做最小化 HTTP 骨架验证，避免触发未实现的业务调用。
